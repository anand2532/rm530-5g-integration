## Upgrade Guide

### Upgrading from v3.x to v4.0

**Automatic migration** - No breaking changes! Just upgrade:

```bash
pip install --upgrade rm530-5g-integration
```

**What's new:**
- Better modem detection that works in all USB modes
- Automatic mode detection before setup
- More informative setup process
- Better error messages when modem not found

**No action required** - all existing configurations and commands work as before.

### Upgrading from v2.0 to v3.0

1. **Python Version**: Ensure Python 3.9+ is installed
   ```bash
   python3 --version  # Should be 3.9 or higher
   ```

2. **Installation**: Upgrade the package
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade rm530-5g-integration
   ```

3. **New Features Available**:
   - Health monitoring: `rm530-health --help`
   - Enhanced CLI output (requires `pip install rm530-5g-integration[rich]`)
   - Retry utilities in Python API

4. **Breaking Changes**:
   - Python 3.9+ required (from 3.8+)
   - All other features are backward compatible

### Upgrading from v1.0 to v3.0

Follow the v2.0 upgrade steps above, and also note:
- Legacy commands still work, but new unified commands are recommended
- Configuration file format remains the same
- Python API has been enhanced but remains backward compatible
